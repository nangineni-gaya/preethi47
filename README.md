## Working of the chatbot
### 1.First item

* The user should enter his/her name and then press the submit buttom down to that.<br>
### 2.Second item
* The bot greets the user by saying "HI!".<br>
* After the submission of user name the bot says" Here are the tasks I can do for you".<br>
* And gives two options<br>
   1.Convert Roman to Integer<br>
   2.Display the Calender<br>
### 3.Third item
* If the user selects "Convert Roman to Integer".Then,the bot asks for "Enter the roman number".<br>
* The user can convert any roman number to integer number by just entering the roman character in the giving space.<br>
* The integer number is displayed with the sentence "Cool! the roman number you have entered is 'integer'.<br>
